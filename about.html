        <h2>What the hell is a MUD?</h2>
        <p>MUD stands for multi-user domain. MUDs are entirely text based. There are absolutely no graphics. Just imagine playing a MMORPG and reading what is occuring in real time as opposed to seeing it.</p>
        <p>MUDs offer 3 distinct things that graphical games do not offer. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Dynamicism</h3>
                <p>MUDs are far more dynamic than visual games because adding video representation of in game functionality takes exponentially more time to develop than the functionality itself. MUDs have such an insane level of dynamicism that the worlds have their own physics engines which makes it so a user can do things that have not even been hardcoded into the game. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Roleplaying and small communities</h3>
                <p>MUDs have a lower player base than major graphical MMOs. On the surface this looks like a bad thing, but it actually is really awesome because the MUDs have a more small town feel where everybody knows everyone else. People have arch enemies, as well as great friends - this small community allows users to create their own storylines in a way no graphical game has ever been able to accomplish. </p>
            </li>

                <h3>Realism</h3> 
                <p>MUDs are not care bear. In most MUDs if you die then WHAM, that's it! Your done. You have to start a new character. Again, this seems like a negative thing but its actually really awesome. When you have had a character for 6 months and you are battling your arch enemy and if you lose it means the past 6 months playing will be over, you will feel adrenaline rush and excitement that is akin to a fight in real life. I have never felt as excited about PVP in a MUD as I ever had in World of Warcraft or any other mainstream MMO</p>
