The outcome for TorkMudClient is to make a cloud based, scriptable, MUD client.
TorkMudClient will be modern in design, availible on any device, and
have the capacity to load user generated code for scripting. The reason this is significant is
most MUD clients are severly outdated and it is very alienating to non-technical
gamers. The beta version for this is expected to be Spring 2014, with a full
release the following year.

This project should not to be confused with the MUD server that is also being created on
this Github account.
